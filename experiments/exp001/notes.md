# Experiment 001 - Initial Pipeline Test

## Goal
Test the basic pose generation stage with SDXL Lightning model using three different seeds.

## Parameters
- Model: SDXL Lightning
- Resolution: 768x1024
- Steps: 20
- CFG Scale: 7.0-7.5
- Seeds: 123456, 789012, 345678

## Expected Outcomes
- Verify ComfyUI integration works correctly
- Test seed reproducibility
- Compare quality across different seeds
- Establish baseline for pose generation

## Notes
(Add observations here after running the experiment)
